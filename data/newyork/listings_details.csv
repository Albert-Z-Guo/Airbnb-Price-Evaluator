Airbnb only collects the first 28 days of rent so I would need you to book in 28 day increments.  Ideally, you would be quiet and very clean and clean up after yourself - not leaving crumbs or a dirty microwave or a clogged mesh filter in the bathroom.  It would be more comfortable to share with a fellow male - gay or straight does not matter. The best thing about this listing is its location. You really do a brisk walk into so many other desirable parts of the city from here.  And I know there are listings charging more for worse locations.  Location is key.

"12568152","Junior 1-bedroom apartment, just a 10 minute walk to the heart of Times Square.  I am a New York native, and I commit to creating a positive and welcoming experience for anyone who honors me by choosing my apartment for their stay in my beloved city.  Welcome! Easily accessible on the first floor - no high flights of stairs to deal with!  Please note the bed size is an American full-size bed.  There's a separate bedroom area, but one needs to walk around the bed to get around it to the bathroom.  It's cozy, but nice and quiet -- a rare find in Hell's Kitchen! Access to full apartment and to the washer/dryer in the basement ($1 for each load).  I will leave laundry detergent and dryer sheets for you to use if you want. Depending on when you arrive, either I or a trusted friend will let you in, pick up the keys when you're about to leave and be available if you encounter any problems with your stay.

I have 2 lovely roommates, a fire escape garden and an expansive rooftop. In the heart of Bed Stuy, short walk to bars, cafes, restaurants and the train. Shared kitchen and bathroom so keep those areas clean for the two lovely roommates and they will do the same. There is a very expansive roof that you can access from the stairs. Be careful up there!

We share a kitchen and a bathroom and you'll have a private room all to yourself with a closet and fire escape. The apartment is on the smaller side, so solo travelers are preferred. Ideal for a student on exchange for the semester or a professional new to NYC. I'm looking for long-term bookings so please rent for 1 month or more. The apartment layout is pretty straightforward: there's a kitchen, a bathroom, your room and my bedroom. What's great is the neighborhood, which you'll love to spend most of your time exploring when you're not busy with the rest that NYC has to offer. You will have an entire room with closet and fire escape to yourself. We're going to be sharing an apartment so I'll usually be available if you need anything, but I'll stay out of your way.
