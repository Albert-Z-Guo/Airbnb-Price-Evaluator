                <p align="justify">
                    During a visit to Brooklyn, New York this summer one of our members began a discussion with their
                    host. Almost immediately listing price emerged, and the host’s questions were many. Was it right for
                    the area? What should we start at for our other apartment? How important was the air conditioning?
                    It became apparent there was a need for pricing clarity and assistance. The idea for our project was
                    born from a direct need.

                The expansion potential for usage is very high, but in this stage, we set out two clear goals.
                First, predict the price of an Airbnb listing as if it were completely new. This is designed for
                potential host’s thinking of joining the Airbnb community. Second, predict the same price with
                detailed historical performance. This would be designed for current hosts who are trying to
                understand the value of their listing, and to aid in evaluating new features.

                Our dataset was provided from three different Kaggle repositories - detailing the same features for
                Boston, Seattle, and New York City (all 5 boroughs included). In order to evaluate our models, we
                performed 5-fold cross validation r squared testing, where our task was to predict the price value for
                an unseen Airbnb. Below is a visualization of each dataset.

            <p width="400" align="justify">
                Our approach was to use multiple different learners on the same dataset, and progressively increase the
                complexity and representation of the features fed into each of our model’s. For our learners we chose
                two separate sets – traditional regressors and ensemble regressors. Our traditional regressors were
                Lasso, Ridge, Elastinet, and Linear Regressors. We chose each of these as they represent a good mix of
                complexity and each can deal with different underlying probability distributions well. Our ensemble
                methods were a random forest, and a gradient boosted regressor – each representing two of the most
                popular ways to optimize based on fundamentally different approaches to bias and variance in any given
                stage. Below is a visualization of the major stages we executed – and the key results section highlights
                our takeaways from the process.</br></br>

        <h2 class="content-head is-center">Key Results</h2>
        <div style="width:60%;margin:0 auto">
            <p width="400" align="justify">
                Throughout the stages of our project, we gained several key insights around the importance of particular
                features and the efficacy of different learners. First, we learned that the critical feature in this
                case was an accurate representation of location – namely using the neighborhood of a listing as opposed
                to latitude and longitude. Additionally, we learned that making sure a given dataset was accurately
                represented is essential (this came from shuffling our NYC dataset more carefully). These two actions
                produced the biggest effect on performance across all learners (represented in stage 1 -> 2). Removing
                outliers in the dataset also was helpful in our understanding and modeling (stage 2 -> 3). Additionally,
                our initial hypothesis that reviews and host features would be excellent model attributes was misguided
                – and we believe this is due to human rating tendencies (bifurcation of scores) and potentially
                manufactured feedback (stage 3 -> 4). Also – we were surprised that sentiment of listing description was
                not as relevant as well, but there is likely additional work that can be done to extract more meaning
                (stage 4 -> 5). In terms of model performance, we learned that no matter the complexity of the simple
                regressor (Ridge and Lasso) they eventually have a difficult time reaching acceptable accuracy with such
                a complex task. We had originally hypothesized that one of the traditional regressors would eventually
                beat out the others – but our work very much shows the importance of using ensemble methods with a
                complex regression task. Finally, throughout the entirety of the project we learned just how important
                the complexity of the underlying dataset is. New York was by far the most difficult market to model, and
                we attempted many different mutations of both our models and the dataset to alleviate this bottleneck.
                This was an excellent learning with a real-world dataset – sometimes significantly more work is required
                to reach acceptable performance, and it is not always clear as to why. Below we have represented our
                outputs for all models and stages both with and without NYC to demonstrate this complexity.
