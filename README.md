Our group will try and address the task of understanding Airbnb market dynamics. There are several different ways to accomplish this goal, but more specifically, we will try and predict the best price for any Airbnb given standard measures such as the location of the listing, the date of pricing, and the features that particular Airbnb offers. This can take several different forms as our project unfolds. Our most promising idea is to try to recommend a price for an individual looking to put a listing on Airbnb for the first time. However, we know that reviews play a strong part of customer perception, so we would also like to explore if any given Airbnb is undervalued or overvalued given their historical performance.

### Datset:

### Process:
1. __Basic__  
   At this stage we want to use the information every listing offers without the need for guest reviews. This will allow us to 
2. Advanced
3. Deep

### Peer Reviews:
- Do we need a cloud instance for training because of the dataset size?
- What is our benchmark or to what is the groundtruth for evaluating the model?
- How do we plan to test the accuracy of our model?
- Does our dataset contain first listing prices and how to we use them?
- Do we plan to use KNNs for Clustering similar listings based on features?
- How doe we know if the predicted price is correct or wrong?
- Which datasets can we add to our project and where are they from?
- Do we have geographic information that might help calculating the price?
